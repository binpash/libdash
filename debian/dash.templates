_Description: Install dash as /bin/sh?
 Bash is the default /bin/sh on a Debian system.  However, since our policy
 requires all shell scripts using /bin/sh to be POSIX compliant, any shell
 that conforms to POSIX can serve as /bin/sh.  Since dash is POSIX
 compliant, it can be used as /bin/sh.  You may wish to do this because
 dash is faster and smaller than bash.
